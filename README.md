# Rented Bikes Prediction Project

This repository contains the code for predicting the number of bicycles rented each day using machine learning models.
The goal of this project is to analyze the provided bike sharing dataset and construct predictive models to accurately forecast the count of rented bicycles.

The dataset provided for this project contains information about bike rentals including features such as weather conditions, temperature, humidity, and season among others.
The target variable to predict is the count of rented bicycles ('count'). 

By comparing the performance of Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost, we aim to determine the optimal model for this prediction task.
